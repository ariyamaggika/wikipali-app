### Organization

The codebase is organized into various .cs files. If modifying the codebase, ensure you are familiar with how it is organized so that
items go into the proper area. If you are unsure about something, ask and we will be happy to give guidance.

### Readable Code

Please make code readable and easy to understand. Comment on any obscure object names or code.

Developers are encouraged to write and share tests for changes made. Please use the automated testing project provided with the solution to verify changes. Forks will be tested prior to merging.

### Pull Requests

It is asked that you are clear in specifying **WHAT** you changed and **WHY**. With that said there is no formal template for pull requests.
You may however be asked to adjust code if organization doesn't flow or code isn't clear. If you plan to make changes to celestial calculations, an explanation of mathematical changes will be sought.

Please submit Pull Requests to the [Develop Branch](https://github.com/Tronald/CoordinateSharp/tree/develop). The Master branch will only contain stable versions.
