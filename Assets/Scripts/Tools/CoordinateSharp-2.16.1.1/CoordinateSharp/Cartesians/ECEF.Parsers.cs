/*
CoordinateSharp is a .NET standard library that is intended to ease geographic coordinate 
format conversions and location based celestial calculations.
https://github.com/Tronald/CoordinateSharp

Many celestial formulas in this library are based on Jean Meeus's 
Astronomical Algorithms (2nd Edition). Comments that reference only a chapter
are referring to this work.
